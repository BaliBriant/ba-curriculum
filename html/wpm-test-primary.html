		<h3>Lakṣman Battles Indrajit</h3>
		<p>In Lanka, Rāvaṇa was stunned. Twice he had celebrated his seeming victory and twice he had been forced to think again. He sat brooding in his palace. This monkey army was charmed. They had been virtually wiped out by Indrajit, but suddenly they were back on their feet and fighting again. Now Kumbhakarna’s two invincible sons had been killed. Things were becoming desperate. Rāvaṇa looked across at Indrajit. This time he must not fail. Rāvaṇa spoke to his son, who was as powerful as his father in every way.</p>
		<p>“O heroic prince, these two mortals must die. Although twice defeated by you, They have somehow miraculously escaped death. Now Their luck must have run out. You are the conqueror of Indra. What then of two humans? Go forth again my son. Use any means whatsoever and kill Them!”</p>
		<p>Once again Indrajit went out from Lanka, accompanied by the remaining force of Rākṣasas. After again worshipping the fire on the battlefield he stood up and began to brag of his power. “The two human brothers may be taken as killed. Today I shall secure an eminent victory for my anxious father. This evening he will rest peacefully, experiencing the highest happiness.”</p>
		<p>The Rākṣasa prince used his powers of sorcery to create a thick blanket of darkness. Rising into the sky, he rushed toward the Vanara army, who were thrown into confusion. He rained down steel arrows in the hundreds of thousands. Again he targeted Rāma and Lakṣman. The two princes were enraged by his treacherous attack. Rāma blazed up like a huge fire fed with volumes of ghee. He bent His great bow into a full circle and released deadly golden shafts that went toward Indrajit in the sky. Using the Shabda-astra, which sought out an invisible opponent, Rāma grievously pierced the demon. He saw His arrows fall to the ground, soaked in the demon’s blood.</p>
		<p>Indrajit drove away from the princes, sending arrows at the monkeys and killing thousands. Seeing this, Lakṣman lost all patience. He fitted an arrow to His bow and spoke to Rāma. “I shall now release the
			<it+>brahmāstra
				<it>, charging it with the power to kill all the Rākṣasas at once. We need tolerate their insolence no longer.”</it>
			</it+>
		</p>
		<p>Rāma reached out and checked His brother. “We should not slay innocent creatures unnecessarily,” He told Him. “The Rākṣasas in Lanka have been sufficiently punished by our assault on their city. Let Us now simply annihilate the remaining warriors. I shall myself immediately kill this Indrajit if he remains on the battlefield for even a moment.”</p>
		<p>Rāma declared that the time for Indrajit’s destruction had come. Even if the Rākṣasa fled for shelter to the farthest reaches of the universe, he would not escape. Rāma raised His bow and looked up to the sky.</p>
		<p>Divining Rāma’s intentions, Indrajit quickly withdrew from the battlefield. He entered Lanka and considered what tactic he should use to kill Rāma and His brother. Using his prodigious mystic powers, he conjured an illusory image of Sītā. Placing this false form on his chariot, he again went out onto the battlefield, this time remaining visible in the sky.</p>
		<p>Hanumān spotted the chariot of Indrajit drawn by its demonic tigers and he rushed toward it with a mountainous crag in his hands. As he looked up, however, he saw a woman held in the demon’s grasp. Although beautiful, she appeared wretched and sorrowful. She was clad in a single garment, unadorned, with her limbs covered in dust and mud. Gazing at her for a while, Hanumān recognized her as Sītā.</p>
		<p>As the monkeys looked on, Indrajit took out his sword and grabbed Sītā by her hair. He began to strike her and she cried out, “Rāma! O Rāma!”</p>
		<p>Hanumān was seized with agony upon seeing this and hot tears fell from his eyes. He angrily rebuked Indrajit. “O wicked one, your act is meant only for your own destruction. Although descended from a Brahmin
			<it+>ṛṣi
				<it>, you are ignoble, mean and sinful. How can you kill a helpless woman, torn from her home and her husband, weak, wretched and crying for protection? Your own death is close. You shall then descend to a dark and condemned region, inhabited by the lowest of creatures.”</it>
			</it+>
		</p>
		<p>Indrajit laughed. Dropping the form of Sītā, he grabbed his bow and loosed off a thousand fierce arrows at Hanumān and the other monkeys. He then took hold of Sītā’s hair again and replied harshly to Hanumān. “She for whom you have all come so far and fought so hard I will now slay. I shall then make short work of Rāma and Lakṣman as well as you, O monkey. I care not for the immorality of my acts, for whatever causes pain to one’s enemy must be achieved by any means.”</p>
		<p>Indrajit raised his sword and cut the form of Sītā into two parts. Laughing loudly, he called out to the monkeys, “Here is Sītā now killed by me. Your efforts to recover her have all been in vain. Fight on, if you must, but all of you will meet the same end as she.”</p>
		<p>The demon rose high into the sky, wheeling about in his golden chariot. Hanumān was seized with grief and anger. Completely infuriated, he fell upon the Rākṣasas in a frenzy. Repeatedly roaring he consumed the Rākṣasa army like the fire of universal dissolution. He took up a massive rock and hurled it straight at Indrajit’s chariot, but the demon rose still higher and the rock fell short. It dropped to the earth, crushing hundreds of demons and opening a chasm in the ground.</p>
		<p>Hanumān was filled with despair. Looking around the at monkey army, he shouted to them, “Cease fighting! The object of our battle is now impossible to achieve, for Sītā lies killed. Let us withdraw and ask Rāma what should be done next.”</p>
		<p>The monkeys pulled away from the fight and moved back toward Rāma and Lakṣman. Seeing this, Indrajit also withdrew, taking the demons with him. He made his way to a sanctuary in a cavern known as Nikumbhila. There he began to perform a ritual for assuring his victory in the battle. Worshipping the powerful goddess Kali, a fearful form of the personified material energy, he made offerings of blood into a sacrificial fire. The demon knew the final battle would soon be fought. He had been granted a boon by Brahmā that once having performed the ritual at Nikumbhila, he would remain completely invincible in battle until his enemy was defeated. The time for realizing that boon had arrived. Surrounded by other Rākṣasas, Indrajit sat before the fire reciting the sacred
