        <p>The test of a pure devotee is that he is always ready to please the Lord. The gopis are a good example.</p>
        <p>Once Krishna had a headache. He called for Narada Muni. “My dear Narada. I have a headache,” He said. “The cure is dust from the feet of my pure devotees. Please get this dust for me.”</p>
        <p>Narada Muni left at once. He went to a place where some brahmanas were making an offering to the Lord. Narada said, “Dear brahmanas, Lord Krishna has a headache. Only the dust from the feet of His devotees will cure it. Can you give me some?”</p>
        <p>The brahmanas bowed before Narada Muni with fear in their hearts. “Dear Narada,” they said, “we cannot give you any dust from our feet. We will go to hell for putting our dust upon the head of the Lord!”</p>
        <p>So Narada left them. Soon he saw some gopis chanting Hare Krishna. “My dear gopis,” said Narada, “Lord Krishna has a headache. He wants some of the dust from your feet to cure it. Will you give me some?”</p>
        <p>The gopis quickly collected dust from their feet. They were very happy. Narada asked them, “Aren’t you afraid of going to hell for giving this dust? Do you know that Krishna wants to put it on His head?”</p>
        <p>The gopis smiled. “We don’t care if we go to hell. Nothing matters to us but Krishna’s happiness. Please take our dust.”</p>
