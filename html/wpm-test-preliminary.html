        <h3>The Priest and The Cobbler</h3>
        <p>The sage, Narada, flew in the sky.He was dancing as he flew from Vaikuntha to Earth. While he danced, Narada played his veena and sang about Krishna.</p>
        <p>There was a priest who saw Narada walking on Earth.Every day this priest prayed to God for people and asked them to give them money and other things they wanted.Then, those people paid him money. He took three baths a day to be very clean. He read many holy books.</p>
        <p>The priest asked Narada, “I know you are going soon to meet the Lord. Would you please ask him when I'm going to get liberation? I want to be free from birth and death.”</p>
        <p>“All right,” Narada agreed.“I'll ask him.”</p>
        <p>As Narada walked on, he met a cobbler who was sitting under a tree. A cobbler makes shoes and fixes them too. Most shoes are made from animal skin, so people usually think cobblers are dirty and can't pray to Vishnu or love him. Although the cobbler's work was very dirty, he did his best work to make people happy.</p>
        <p>When Narada walked by the cobbler's shop, the cobbler asked him “Are you going to see the Lord? Will you please ask him when I'll be with him again in Vaikuntha?”</p>
        <p>When Narada Muni went to the Vaikuntha planets, he did as he promised and asked Lord Vishnu about the priest and the cobbler.</p>
        <p>Vishnu replied, “After his body dies, the cobbler will come here to me.”</p>
        <p>“What about the priest?” Narada asked.</p>
        <p>“He will have to stay there for many more births and deaths.I do not know when he is coming,” Vishnu said.</p>
        <p>Narada Muni couldn't understand, and he thought and thought.Then he said “Please explain this mystery.”</p>
        <p>Vishnu smiled, “You will understand soon.”</p>
        <p>“When they ask you what I'm doing in Vaikuntha tell him that I'm putting an elephant through the hole in the needle.”</p>
        <p>When Narada went back to earth, he went to the priest's house. The priest asked, “Have you seen the Lord? When did he say I'll get liberation?”</p>
        <p>Narada answered, “He said he doesn't know, but it will be many births and deaths.”</p>
        <p>“Hmph!” scowled the priest.“What was Vishnu doing?”</p>
        <p>“He was putting an elephant through the hole in a needle,” Narada answered.</p>
        <p>“I don't believe such rubbish,” the priest shouted “I don't think you really saw him at all!”</p>
        <p>Narada then left and went on to the cobbler, who asked him, “Have you seen my Lord? would you please tell me what he was doing?” </p>
        <p>“He was putting an elephant through the hole in the needle,” Narada replied.</p>
        <p> The cobbler began to cry in love for God, “Oh, my Lord is so wonderful. He can do anything”</p>
        <p>“Do you really think that the lord can push an elephant through the hole of a needle?” Narada asked.</p>
        <p>“Why not?” the cobbler said, “Of course I think it is true.”</p>
        <p>“How could it be true?” asked Narada.</p>
        <p>“You can see that I am sitting under this giant banyan tree,” the cobbler answered “and you can see that so mnay fruits are falling everyday. In each seed there is a banyan tree like this one. So we can see that the lord put a big tree within a small seed. Is it hard to understand that the Lord is pushing the elephant through the hole of a needle. ”</p>
        <p>Narada started to dance. “Lord Vishnu said you will go to Vaikuntha when your body dies,” he said and the cobbler danced with him.</p>
